@import 'app/app.component';

// Individual components styles such as article-list.component.scss get included by their .ts file
// That way, you can use :host {} as the selector which is pretty cool,
// but of course it stops you from being able to control the order of the includes,
// so they have to be reeeaally discrete (which is appropropriate for component styles)
